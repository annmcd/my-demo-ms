Hi Ann,
See attached a summary of what I found/noticed at No. 103 Ranelagh Village.
I've also attached an assessment of the value of the property based on the current rent etc.
As far as I can see, the property is in good condition and you are getting it at a good price.
Give me a ring if you need to discuss any of the above or the attached.
